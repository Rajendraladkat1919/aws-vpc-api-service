# aws-vpc-api-service
This repository contains the code which create aws vpc using api.

1. Terraform Best Practices
Lock Provider and Terraform Versions:
Already done in your versions.tf files.
Remote State & Locking:
You use S3 and DynamoDB for state and locking—this is production-grade.
Backend Security:
Enable bucket versioning and server-side encryption (done).
Add bucket policies to restrict access to trusted IAM users/roles only.
Sensitive Variables:
Use environment variables or encrypted secrets for sensitive values.
2. Module Structure
Core Module:
Centralize IAM roles/policies and outputs for cross-module usage.
Networking Module:
VPC, subnets, and gateways should be parameterized for CIDR, AZs, etc.
Database Module:
DynamoDB table for state locking and metadata.
Serverless Module:
Lambda/API Gateway resources, referencing IAM roles from the core module.
3. Security
IAM Policies:
Use least privilege—restrict Lambda, API Gateway, and other roles to only required actions.
S3 Bucket Policy:
Restrict access to the state bucket.
DynamoDB Table Policy:
Restrict access to the lock table.
4. Configuration & Environment Separation
Use workspaces or separate variable files for dev, staging, and prod environments.
Parameterize environment-specific values (e.g., tags, resource names).
5. Outputs & Documentation
Ensure all modules output key resources (ARNs, IDs, endpoints).
Update README.md with:
Module descriptions
Usage instructions
Prerequisites (Terraform, AWS credentials)
How to deploy (init, plan, apply)
How to destroy
6. CI/CD Integration
Use tools like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Bitbucket Pipelines for:
Terraform format/lint checks
Automated plan/apply (with approval gates for production)
State file protection
7. Testing & Validation
Use terraform validate and terraform plan in CI.
Optionally, use Terratest or similar tools for infrastructure testing.
8. Tagging & Resource Management
Tag all resources with Environment, Owner, Project, etc.
Use resource naming conventions for clarity.
9. Sensitive Data Handling
Never commit secrets or credentials.
Use AWS Secrets Manager or SSM Parameter Store for runtime secrets.
10. Disaster Recovery
Enable S3 bucket versioning and lifecycle policies for state backup.
Document recovery steps in case of accidental deletion.
Summary:
Your repo is well-structured. To make it production-ready, focus on security (IAM, S3/DynamoDB policies), environment separation, CI/CD, documentation, and resource tagging.
Let me know if you want code samples for any of these improvements!
